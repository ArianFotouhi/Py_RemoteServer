# TOLO_FastAPI_App

A FastAPI application is designed to efficiently shorten URLs, which proves beneficial when dealing with long and intricate web addresses. This process involves converting lengthy URLs into concise forms, making them easier to manage and share.

The choice of FastAPI as the development framework stems from its rapid development capabilities and straightforward nature. Despite its user-friendly interface, FastAPI offers robust data type validation for incoming requests. This ensures that the data being sent conforms precisely to the expected formats, promoting accurate and reliable interactions.

```bash
uvicorn main:app
```

if not worked, try: 

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app
```
